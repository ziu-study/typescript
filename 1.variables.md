## Differences between `var`, `let`, and `const`

### var
1️⃣ `var` has function scope; however, this is usually not an issue in TypeScript.

From the code below, `bottomVar` is hoisted to the top and can be accessed; however, its value is assigned later. This means only the variable declaration is hoisted, and the compiler reports the error "Variable 'bottomVar' is used before being assigned." Although it may still run, this can be problematic.

```typescript
function testVar() {
    var topVar = "define at top"
    console.log(topVar)
    console.log(bottomVar) // Got Error: Variable 'bottomVar' is used before being assigned.

    var bottomVar = "define"
}
```

2️⃣ Can you assign another value?

Yes — its value can be changed.

```typescript
function testVar() {
    var count = 1
    console.log(count) // 1
    count = 2
    console.log(count) // 2
}
```

However, because TypeScript is statically typed, you cannot assign a value of a different type.
```typescript
function testVar() {
    var count = 1
    console.log(count)
    count = "2"
    console.log(count)
}
```

## let
1️⃣ `let` has block scope and cannot be accessed outside its block.
```typescript
function testVar() {
    console.log(innerVar) // Cannot find variable 'innerVar'

    {
        let innerVar = 1
    }
}

// Updated to var
function testVar() {
    console.log(innerVar) // undefined  

    {
        var innerVar = 1
    }
}
```

2️⃣ Can you assign another value?

Yes — both `var` and `let` variables can be reassigned. This differs from Swift; the main difference here is scope.
```typescript
function testVar() {
    let v1 = 1
    console.log(v1) // 1
    v1 = 2
    console.log(v1) // 2
}
testVar()
```

### const
To prevent a value from being changed, use `const`.

```typescript
function testVar() {
    const PI = 3.14
    PI = 3.1412 // Attempted to assign to readonly property. 
}
testVar()

// Declaring a const without an initializer causes an error.
function testVar() {
    const PI: number // Error: 'const' declarations must be initialized.
    PI = 3.14
}
testVar()
```
